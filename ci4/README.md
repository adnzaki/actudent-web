# Actudent CI4

## What is this?
Actudent CI4 is a personal project from Adnan Zaki (WolesDev Team). Basically, this is the same version as Actudent but it is built on CodeIgniter4 pre-alpha4. The main purpose of this project is to try how the project runs on CodeIgniter4 which is more modern version of CodeIgniter 3.x framework. While CodeIgniter4 is not ready for production use, it means this project is just an experiment until the final public version of CodeIgniter4 released.

## How it works?
Actudent CI4 is built on modular programming concept to separate each sub-program into modules. The 'Actudent' namespace is the root of the modules and used by all app-specific source code. If you don't have any knowledge about namespace in PHP, try to learn it first.

## Directory Structure
This project uses modular concept to manage codebase. All app-spesific source code placed in "actudent" directory, there are sub-directories called "Admin" to store admin-specific section source code and "Core" to store core application code. All global config or source code placed in CI's "app" directory.

## Want to contribute?
