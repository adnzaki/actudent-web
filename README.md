# Actudent CI4

## What is this?
Actudent CI4 is a personal project from Adnan Zaki (WolesDev Team). This project is the return of previous version of Actudent. The main difference of both project is the framework. While the previous version still using CodeIgniter 3, Actudent CI4 (as its name) built on top of CodeIgniter 4. Because of CodeIgniter 4 has reached its beta version, my team and I decided to continue Actudent project on CodeIgniter 4.

## Why CodeIgniter 4?
CodeIgniter 4 is a rewrite version of CodeIgniter, everything is written from scratch. CodeIgniter 4 requires PHP 7.2+ to make it runs. CodeIgniter 4 also has been using the maximum power of PHP 7.2+, it makes the framework comes much better than previous version. Performance, feature, security, etc. increased rapidly. The newer version means a better version, there is no reason to stay with the older version.

## How it works?
Actudent CI4 is built on modular programming concept to separate each sub-program into modules. The 'Actudent' namespace is the root of the modules and used by all app-specific source code. If you don't have any knowledge about namespace in PHP, try to learn it first.

## Directory Structure
This project uses modular concept to manage codebase. All app-spesific source code placed in "actudent" directory, there are sub-directories called "Admin" to store admin-specific section source code and "Core" to store core application code. All global config or source code placed in CI's "app" directory.

## Want to contribute?
This project uses CodeIgniter 4 as the server-side engine and Vue.js for its Javascript framework. Experience of both tools is required to contribute to this project.
